# Tic Tac Toe - Java Implementation

This repository contains a Java program for a single-player Tic Tac Toe game. You play against the computer, which uses a random selection method to choose its moves.

### Features
- Play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.
- Random AI for computer turns.
- Tracks the current game state.
- Announces the winner (or tie) at the end of the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- An IDE of your choice (like VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Running the Game:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Compile the Java source code using the command line - javac TicTacToe.java
4. Run the game using the command line - java TicTacToe

### Gameplay:

The game will display the Tic Tac Toe board and prompt you to enter your move by specifying the numbers between 1 to 9 (here 1 being the first column of the first row). The computer will then make its random move utilizing the random selection method. The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie.

### Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and make improvements!

Here are some ideas:

- Implement minimax AI for a more challenging computer opponent.
- Add visual representation of the board (text-based or GUI).
- Allow players to choose their symbol (X or O).


This project is intended for the demonstration of a basic Tic Tac Toe game implementation in Java.
